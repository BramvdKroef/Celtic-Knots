* Requirements
- Java
- Apache Ant

* Build

In the base directory (where build.xml) is run 'ant build' to build
the project or 'ant dist' to create a .jar file in the dist directory. 

* Usage

Run 'java dist/dist-{timestamp}.jar'. Two optional arguments change
the size of the knot. The default is 5. To double the size, for
example, use: 'java dist/dist-{timestamp}.jar 10 10'.

Click on a dot to highlight it. Then click on one under it, above it
or next to it to break up the pattern. The buttons on the bottom will
let you change line style, hide the grid and change the colors.

Have fun.
