* Requirements
- Java
- Apache Ant

* Build

In the base directory (where build.xml) is run 'ant build' to build
the project or 'ant dist' to create a .jar file in the dist directory. 

* Usage

Run 'java dist/dist-{timestamp}.jar'. Two optional arguments change
the size of the knot. The default is 5. To double the size, for
example, use: 'java dist/dist-{timestamp}.jar 10 10'.
